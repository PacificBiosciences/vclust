<p align="center">A tool to detect variation clusters in PacBio HiFi sequencing data</p>

***

Variation clusters are loosely defined as contiguous regions that contain some
variation in a given set of genomes. The `vclust` method is designed to locate
variation clusters around an input set of seed regions using variation extracted
from PacBio HiFi whole-genome sequencing data.

Authors: [Egor Dolzhenko](mailto:edolzhenko@pacificbiosciences.com)

## Installation and usage

`vclust` can be built from source (requires Rust, which can be installed with the
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/) tool).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PacificBiosciences/vclust.git
cd vclust
cargo build --release
```

Once installed, `vclust` can be run like so:

```bash
./vclust --genome genome.fa --reads bams/*.bam --regions regions.bed > extended_regions.txt
```

where

* `genome.fa` is the reference genome (the same reference genome as used for
    read alignment)
* `bams/*.bam` paths to the aligned PacBio HiFi BAM files
* `regions.bed` a BED file with seed regions to extend
* `extended_regions.txt` an output file with the extended regions

The input file `regions.bed` is expected to contain coordinates and identifiers
of the regions to be profiled.

```csv
chr1    57367043        57367119        region1
chr1    146228800       146228821       region2
chr1    149390802       149390841       region3
chr10   79826383        79826404        region4
chr10   93702522        93702547        region5
chr11   66744821        66744850        region6
chr11   119206289       119206322       region7
```

The output file `extended_regions.txt` contains region identifiers (column 1),
coordinates of the original input regions (column 2), input regions' start / end
extension lengths (columns 3,4), and coordinates of the corresponding extended
regions (column 5). If `vclust` is unable to extend a given region (due to, say,
the lack of read coverage), the third column is set to `NA`.

```csv
region1 chr1:57367043-57367119      0    0       chr1:57367043-57367119
region2 chr1:146228800-146228821   NA
region3 chr1:149390802-149390841    0    0       chr1:149390802-149390841
region4 chr10:79826383-79826404    72    0       chr10:79826311-79826404
region5 chr10:93702522-93702547     0    0       chr10:93702522-93702547
region6 chr11:66744821-66744850     0    0       chr11:66744821-66744850
region7 chr11:119206289-119206322   0    0       chr11:119206289-119206322
```

In the example above, `vclust` did not identify significant variation around
`region1` and hence the extension lengths were set to 0. The reported extended
region in column 5 is the original region itself. On the other hand, the start
of `region4` was extended by 72 bps, expanding coordinates of the original
region from `chr10:79826383-79826404` to `chr10:79826311-79826404`.

## Variation plots

We also provide [a script for creating variation plots](utils/variation_plot.py)
(see "Citation" for details). The simplest way to run this script is with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) project manager like so:

```bash
uv run utils/variation_plot.py --reads samples/*.bam --region chrX:147912050-147912110 --padding 150 --image FMR1.png
```

where `--reads` specifies the paths to all BAM files you'd like to visualize,
`--region` specifies the region of interest, `--padding` is the amount of sequence
around the region of interest to visualize, `--image` is the path to the output image.

This is what the resulting plot looks like:
